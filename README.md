# 📚 The Most Common Word

This project provides a Python function that identifies the most frequently occurring word in a given text and returns its count. It includes tests to validate its functionality, ensuring reliability and robustness.

## 🛠️ Features

- Extracts and counts words using **regular expressions** and Python's `Counter` class.
- Handles **case insensitivity**, **special characters**, and edge cases like empty text or ties.
- Fully tested with **pytest** and type-checked using **mypy**.


## 🔧 Installation

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. To set up the environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Kinetics20/the_most_common_word.git
   cd the_most_common_word
    ```

## Install Dependencies

To install Poetry, Mypy and Pytest on Linux or macOS, use the following command:

```bash
pipx install poetry
poetry add mypy
poetry add 'pytest==8.3.4'
```

## 🚀 Usage

The main function `most_common_word` analyzes a given text and returns the most frequent word.  
Example Code:

```python
from common_word import most_common_word

text = "Home is where I feel safe, but the house I grew up in will always be home to me."
result = most_common_word(text)
print(result)  # Output: ('home', 2)
```

## ✅ Tests

The project includes unit tests written using `pytest` to validate the function’s behavior.  
Run Tests:

```bash
pytest test_common_word.py -vv
```

    Returns:
        tuple[str, int]: The most frequently occurring word in the text.
    """
    words: list[str] = re.findall(r'\b\w+\b', txt.lower())
    if not words:
        return '', 0

    word_counts: Counter[str] = Counter(words)
    return word_counts.most_common(n=1)[0]
